# Goal

<span style="font-size:24px">
The goal of this project is to understand whether prior knowledge can influence the sensitivity of visual detection. As humans live in the world, they have picked up various regularities to form expectations about their surroundings. For example, most of us would expect to see the image on the left (or upper) in an airport rather than the image on the right (or lower). In this project, we focused on how familiarity influences the detection of rapidly flashed stimuli.

# Background

<span style="font-size:24px">
How prior experience influences human behaviors has been a popular topic across many divisions in Psychology, such as the own race effect in social psychology. But, whether these prior experiences can affect human perception is still up for debate. Some reserchers (e.g., Firestone & Scholl, 2016) argued that low-level perception, the ones happening at retina or at the primary visual cortex, is not influenced by our experiences. For example, visual illusions (e.g., Stepping feet illusion: seeing two blocks 'step' asynchrously but in fact they are moving simultenously) are still effective even if we know that they are results of our visual system.

<span style="font-size:24px">
On the other hand, several studies, including our own work, have shown that our perception can be influenced by prior experiences. Peterson (1994) summarized her work on how experience (i.e., object recognition) can precede figure-ground organization. As you can see, most people will consider the black areas as more dominant than the white areas. This is because the black areas are recognizable objects while the white areas are not. This effect will not occur if object recognition does not precede figure-ground segregation.

# Method

<span style="font-size:24px">
In this project, we adopted an intact-scrambled task. This task requires participants to respond as to whether a rapidly flashed image is an intact image or a scrambled image. We manipulated whether the target image was a familiar item or not. Most importantly, familiarity with the item has **no** bearing on task performance.

# Results

<span style="font-size:24px">
Results showed that participants can better detect familiar objects (logos and faces) and familiar orientation (upright or inverse) than unfamiliar artifitial objects. This result supports the idea that visual perception can be influenced by our prior experiences. We can detect something better when we expect to see them.
