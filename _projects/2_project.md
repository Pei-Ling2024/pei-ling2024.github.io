# Background

<span style="font-size:24px">
Categorization is a fundamental cognitive process that underlies many cognitive functions (e.g., separating spoiled food, finding your friends). Over the past sixty years, modern psychology has been exploring the structure of categories in the human mind. Understanding category structure involves studying how each member of a category is represented in our minds and arranged in some way. For instance, you might represent animals in terms of their size and whether they are predators. The space constructed by the dimensions of size and predator is the category space of the animal category in this example.

Past research on human categorization has mainly focused on artificial objects (e.g., letters) with clear and distinct feature sets. Recently, with improvements in computational power, many studies have shifted to understanding objects in real-life pictures. In the current project, we further extend the exploration to natural scenes (e.g., beach, city, highway) that contain both objects and the relationships among them.

# Results
<span style="font-size:24px">
Followings are the category spaces from human categorization task (upper) and from the last layer of DNNs (lower). As shown in the space, results showed that the human category space constructed from the categorization task was not predicted well by any feature space produced from the models.
