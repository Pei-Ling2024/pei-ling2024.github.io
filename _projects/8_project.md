# Goal

<span style="font-size:24px">
To find a reliable representation for category members, comparing different categorization tasks is crucial.

# Background

<span style="font-size:24px">
Categorization is a fundamental cognitive process that underlies many cognitive functions (e.g., separating spoiled food, finding your friends). To study how humans categorize items, many tasks have been proposed. Most categorization tasks are based on similarity measures. That is, when deciding whether an item belongs to a category, some psychologists assume that the similarity of the new item to either all the other members of that category (i.e., exemplar theory) or the mean of that category (i.e., prototype theory) is computed. The new item will be categorized as belonging to the category to which it has the highest similarity.

Three categorization tasks are tested: arrangement task, same-different judgement task, and odd-one-out task.

# Results

<span style="font-size:24px">
Followings are the category spaces from human categorization task (upper) and from the last layer of DNNs (lower). As shown in the space, results showed that the human category space constructed from the categorization task was not predicted well by any feature space produced from the models.
